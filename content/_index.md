## About this site

All developers at one point have said to themselves, ["I know how to program, but I don't know what
to program"](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program). 

This website was created to help. It features programming projects, resources, and tutorials to
inspire you to code.
